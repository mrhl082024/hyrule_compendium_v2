          <p>
            My goals for this project was to learn more about prop drilling,
            condtional statements, useState, browserouter, how to cache data,
            Api calls and data structure. I'm very happy with what i've been
            able to create, although it's mostly text and images so nothing
            fancy, it's still a proof to myself that i'm aquiring new knowlegde
            and improving upon my existing ones :3
