            My goals for this project was to learn more about prop drilling,
            condtional statements, useState, browserouter, how to cache data,
            Api calls and data structure. <br /> I'm very happy with what i've
            been able to create, although it's mostly text and images so nothing
            fancy, it's still a proof to myself that i'm aquiring new knowlegde
            and improving upon my existing ones :3
